# LetsWorkSomethingOut
Me just trying to understand something about git

First thing's first - I've just cloned this repo and now I'm making a single commit locally.

Now, straight away, I'm making a second commit.

[2020-01-10] Soon after I made this repo, back in October last year, I kinda realised what I was going to try out wouldn't work / I managed to convince myself that was I was trying to prove was true. Anyway, I'm gonna generally experiment with git now
